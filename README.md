  ## Coding in Java & JavaFX

Our CS102 Project me and my friends have put together in our first year in college (more info can be found within the app).
CodingWizard aims to help beginners to Java learn the very basics of the language, such as data types, if conditionals, loops and methods.
It provides lectures and challenges to sharper the skills of the users, grants them points for each succesful challenge and stores this inside a database.

One of the major problems we faced during the development of this app was to compile and run the code written by the user to a TextArea.
The solution to this problem needs the app to be run from an IDE (preferably IntelliJ) and not from a .jar file.
